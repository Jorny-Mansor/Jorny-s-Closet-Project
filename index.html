    <p>Here you will find my experiments and progress in the Newman Creative Coding class</p>
    <P> For my first project i have created this website and written all of this. But to go along will continue to write more paragraphs and headers and even go as far to try and write or create images.</P>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/journey_nm/?utm_source=qr">If you click this link it will take you to my instagram account.</a>

<h2>Section one: Clothing website</h2>
<p>For my next project on my website I will try to make a section of my website that will present images of outfits and clothing that I like. if possible i will tryr to make it so when you click on the image it brings you to another link or show you each individual item.</p>

<h3>My Fits</h3>
<p>Below there are a few of my outfits that you can find when you click on the link above on my instagram or if you simply click on the picture</p>

  <p> In this outfit, it is pretty funnny because I don't think I paid for anything but the shoes, hat, and glasses. The pants in this images I actually got from Walmart because they were for a school activity and instead of wearing them once and throwing them to the side I deicded to use them again for this outfit. As for the jacket and the shirt those were both hand-me-downs from my brothers.  </p>

  <p>In this outfit I am wearing a jacket with a track competition numbers on it which i got from my brother. As for the shirt it is the same as the one in the image above. The pants have a kind of dirty work look to them which i really like. I also got these jeans form my brother and the only thing i really paid for in this image is my shoes. My shoes are Doc Martins.</p>
